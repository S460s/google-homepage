This is my first project - Google homepage.
I am going to test my skills at HTML and CSS.
_______________________________________________

The homepage is ready!
It took me around 4 or 5 hours and a lot of googling.
I know it is not either near perfect but that's what I can do for now.

I learned a lot of stuff some of which:
    positioning images,
    making navbars,
    using the dev tools,
    how to make a project from scratch,
    and some others,

I might come back to this project later on and see how much better I am going to perform.
